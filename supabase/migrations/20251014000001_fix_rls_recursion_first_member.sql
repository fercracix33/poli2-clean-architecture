/**
 * Fix RLS Recursion for Organization Creation
 *
 * CRITICAL FIX: Resolves error 42501 when adding first member to new organization.
 *
 * Problem:
 * - When user creates organization, they must be added as first member
 * - RLS policy on organization_members checks if user is admin
 * - Admin check queries organization_members table
 * - Table is EMPTY (this is the first member!) â†’ RECURSION/FAILURE
 *
 * Solution:
 * - Create SECURITY DEFINER function that bypasses RLS for first member ONLY
 * - Validates: user is creator, organization has 0 members
 * - Subsequent members use normal RLS (security maintained)
 *

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.add_first_organization_member IS
'SECURITY DEFINER function to add the first member to a new organization, bypassing RLS.

This function resolves the RLS recursion issue where adding the first member fails because
the RLS policy checks if the user is an admin (which requires querying an empty table).

Security Features:
- Validates user is the organization creator
- Validates organization has exactly 0 members (first member only)
- Validates user is adding themselves
- SET search_path prevents injection attacks
- Subsequent members use normal RLS (this is for first member ONLY)

Usage:
  SELECT add_first_organization_member(
    ''org-uuid''::uuid,
    ''user-uuid''::uuid,
    ''role-uuid''::uuid
  );
