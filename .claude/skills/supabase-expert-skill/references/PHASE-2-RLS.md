# Phase 2: RLS Policy Implementation

**STATUS**: ⚠️ MOST CRITICAL PHASE - 80% of Supabase issues come from RLS mistakes

## Purpose

Implement Row Level Security policies that are secure, performant, and free of circular dependencies. This phase prevents the most common production issues in Supabase applications.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY RLS policy, verify:

- [ ] ✅ Phase 0 Context7 consultation complete
- [ ] ✅ Context7 findings documented
- [ ] ✅ Phase 1 schema complete with ALL indexes on RLS columns
- [ ] ✅ Understand circular policy anti-patterns
- [ ] ✅ Know security definer function patterns
- [ ] ✅ Read [RLS-ANTI-PATTERNS.md](RLS-ANTI-PATTERNS.md) completely

**If you cannot check ALL boxes, STOP and complete prerequisites first.**

## Core RLS Principles (from Context7)

### 1. Wrap auth.uid() in SELECT (PERFORMANCE)

**❌ SLOW**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "bad" ON tasks
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**✅ OPTIMIZED**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "good" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Why**: `(SELECT auth.uid())` creates an initPlan, caching the result per statement instead of evaluating per row.

**Performance impact**: Up to 100x faster on large tables.

---

### 2. Always Specify TO Role (SECURITY + PERFORMANCE)

**❌ BAD**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "policy" ON tasks
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
-- Evaluates for ALL roles (anon, authenticated, service_role)
```

**✅ GOOD**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "policy" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Why**: Policy only evaluates for `authenticated` role, preventing wasteful evaluation for anonymous users.

**Performance impact**: 30-50% improvement for endpoints with anonymous access.

---

### 3. Avoid Joins to Source Table (CRITICAL - CIRCULAR POLICIES)

**❌ CIRCULAR (causes infinite loops)**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "circular_bad" ON tasks
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_user
      WHERE team_user.team_id = tasks.team_id  -- ⚠️ Joins back to source!
    )
  );
```

**✅ SAFE (no join to source)**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "safe_good" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_user
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())  -- No reference to tasks table
    )
  );
```

**Why**: Joining to source table creates circular dependencies and prevents query optimization.

---

### 4. Use Security Definer Functions for Complex Logic

**✅ BEST PRACTICE**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create security definer function (bypasses RLS on lookup table)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_team_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT team_id
    FROM team_user
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Step 2: Use in RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "best_practice" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT get_user_team_ids())
  );
```

**Why**:
- Function runs with creator's privileges (bypasses RLS on `team_user`)
- Optimizes query plan (pre-fetches team IDs)
- Reusable across multiple policies
- Prevents circular dependencies

---

### 5. Index ALL RLS-Filtered Columns (MANDATORY)

**Before creating policies, verify indexes exist**:
```sql
-- Check existing indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'tasks';

-- If missing, create them NOW
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_team_id ON tasks(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_org_id ON tasks(organization_id);
```

**Why**: Without indexes, RLS causes sequential scans on large tables (100x slower).

---

## RLS Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Enable RLS

```sql
ALTER TABLE [table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

---

### Step 2: Create Security Definer Helper Functions

**Standard multi-tenant helpers**:

```sql
-- Get user's organization IDs
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_organization_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT organization_id
    FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Check if user can access specific organization
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can_access_organization(org_id UUID)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND organization_id = org_id
  );
END;
$$;
```

**Why SET search_path = public**: Prevents schema injection attacks.

---

### Step 3: Create SELECT Policy (Read)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "[table]_select_own_org" ON [table_name]
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Option 1: Use helper function (RECOMMENDED)
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())

    -- Option 2: Direct subquery (if no helper exists)
    -- organization_id IN (
    --   SELECT organization_id
    --   FROM user_organizations
    --   WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
    -- )
  );
```

---

### Step 4: Create INSERT Policy (Create)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "[table]_insert_own_org" ON [table_name]
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Verify organization access
    (SELECT can_access_organization(organization_id))

    -- Verify user_id matches authenticated user
    AND (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

**Note**: Use `WITH CHECK`, not `USING`, for INSERT policies.

---

### Step 5: Create UPDATE Policy (Modify)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "[table]_update_own" ON [table_name]
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Can only update own records in own organization
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
    AND organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Prevent changing ownership or organization
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
    AND organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );
```

**Note**: Both `USING` (what you can select) and `WITH CHECK` (what update must satisfy).

---

### Step 6: Create DELETE Policy (Remove)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "[table]_delete_own" ON [table_name]
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Can only delete own records
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---

## RLS Verification (MANDATORY)

### 1. Check for Circular Dependencies

```sql
-- View all policies on table
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  pg_get_expr(qual, oid) AS policy_condition
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = '[table_name]';
```

**Review each policy_condition**:
- ✅ No references to source table columns
- ✅ All use security definer functions or safe subqueries
- ✅ No joins back to source table

---

### 2. Validate Performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM [table_name]
WHERE organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
LIMIT 100;
```

**Expected output**:
```
Index Scan using idx_[table]_org_id on [table_name]
  (cost=X.XX..Y.YY rows=100)
```

**❌ BAD (if you see this)**:
```
Seq Scan on [table_name]
  Filter: ...
```

**Fix**: Add missing index on organization_id.

---

### 3. Test Multi-User Isolation

```sql
-- Test as user 1
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-uuid-1';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];
-- Should only see user-1's organization data

-- Test as user 2
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-uuid-2';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];
-- Should only see user-2's organization data

-- Test as anonymous (should fail or return 0)
RESET ROLE;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];

-- Reset
SET ROLE authenticated;
```

---

### 4. Measure Query Performance

```sql
-- Simple query should be < 50ms
SET client_min_messages = 'log';
\timing on

SELECT * FROM [table_name]
WHERE organization_id = 'test-org-id'
LIMIT 100;

\timing off
```

**Target**: < 50ms for simple queries with proper indexes.

---

## Common RLS Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Organization Isolation

```sql
CREATE POLICY "org_isolation" ON [table]
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );
```

---

### Owner-Only Access

```sql
CREATE POLICY "owner_only" ON [table]
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---

### Team-Based Access (NO CIRCULAR JOIN)

```sql
-- Helper function first
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_team_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Policy using helper
CREATE POLICY "team_access" ON [table]
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT get_user_team_ids())
  );
```

---

### Role-Based Access

```sql
-- Helper function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION has_role(required_role TEXT)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = required_role
  );
END;
$$;

-- Policy
CREATE POLICY "admin_access" ON [table]
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT has_role('admin')) OR (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---
