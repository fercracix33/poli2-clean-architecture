# RLS Best Practices

**SOURCE**: Context7 consultation - Latest Supabase/PostgreSQL patterns

**PURPOSE**: Proven patterns for high-performance, secure RLS policies

## Core Best Practices

### 1. Wrap auth.uid() in SELECT (Performance)

**Pattern**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "optimized" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Why**: Postgres optimizer creates an `initPlan`, caching auth.uid() result per statement instead of evaluating per row.

**Performance impact**: Up to 100x faster on large tables.

**From Context7**:
> "This technique allows the PostgreSQL optimizer to cache the function's result per statement, preventing redundant calls for each row and significantly improving performance."

---

### 2. Always Specify TO Role

**Pattern**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "role_specific" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated  -- ← Specify role
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Why**: Policy only evaluates for specified role, skipping unnecessary checks for `anon` users.

**Performance impact**: 30-50% improvement for public endpoints.

**From Context7**:
> "By targeting specific roles, the policy's logic only executes for those intended users, preventing unnecessary processing and enhancing security."

---

### 3. Use Security Definer Functions

**Pattern**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create helper function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_organization_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT organization_id
    FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Step 2: Use in policy
CREATE POLICY "org_access" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );
```

**Why**:
- Function runs with creator's privileges (bypasses RLS on lookup table)
- Optimizes query plan (pre-fetches organization IDs)
- Reusable across multiple policies
- Prevents circular dependencies

**From Context7**:
> "Illustrates how to use a SECURITY DEFINER function to query other tables without triggering their Row Level Security policies."

---

### 4. Avoid Joins to Source Table

**Anti-pattern (CIRCULAR)**:
```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Joins to source table
CREATE POLICY "circular" ON tasks
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_members
      WHERE team_members.team_id = tasks.team_id  -- ← CIRCULAR!
    )
  );
```

**Correct pattern**:
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: No join to source table
CREATE POLICY "safe" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())  -- No reference to tasks
    )
  );
```

**Why**: Circular references prevent query optimization and can cause infinite loops.

**From Context7**:
> "Instead of direct column comparisons in the WHERE clause, pre-fetch join data into an array or set and use IN or ANY operations."

---

### 5. Use IN with Subqueries (Not Joins)

**Pattern**:
```sql
-- Pre-fetch relevant IDs into a set
CREATE POLICY "prefetch" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id
      FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
    )
  );
```

**Alternative with ANY**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "any_pattern" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id = ANY(ARRAY(
      SELECT team_id
      FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
    ))
  );
```

**Why**: IN/ANY with subqueries allows Postgres to optimize the lookup without circular dependencies.

**From Context7**:
> "Restructures the subquery to fetch the relevant team_id values based on auth.uid() and then uses an IN operator."

---

### 6. Index ALL RLS-Filtered Columns

**Pattern**:
```sql
-- Create indexes BEFORE enabling RLS
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_org_id ON tasks(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_team_id ON tasks(team_id);

-- Then enable RLS and create policies
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "indexed_policy" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Why**: Without indexes, RLS causes sequential scans (100x slower on large tables).

**From Context7**:
> "Indexing columns involved in RLS conditions significantly improves query performance by optimizing data retrieval."

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Organization Isolation

```sql
-- Helper function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_organization_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT organization_id
    FROM user_organizations
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Policy
CREATE POLICY "org_isolation" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );
```

---

### Owner-Only Access

```sql
CREATE POLICY "owner_only" ON tasks
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---

### Team-Based Access (No Circular Join)

```sql
-- Helper function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_team_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT team_id
    FROM team_members
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

-- Policy
CREATE POLICY "team_access" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT get_user_team_ids())
  );
```

---

### Role-Based Access

```sql
-- Helper function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION has_role(required_role TEXT)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = required_role
  );
END;
$$;

-- Policy
CREATE POLICY "admin_access" ON tasks
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT has_role('admin')) OR (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---

### Hierarchical Permissions

```sql
-- Helper function for team hierarchy
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can_access_team_hierarchy(team_uuid UUID)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    WITH RECURSIVE team_tree AS (
      -- Base case: teams user is member of
      SELECT team_id
      FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()

      UNION

      -- Recursive case: parent teams
      SELECT t.parent_team_id
      FROM teams t
      INNER JOIN team_tree tt ON t.team_id = tt.team_id
      WHERE t.parent_team_id IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT 1 FROM team_tree WHERE team_id = team_uuid
  );
END;
$$;

-- Policy
CREATE POLICY "hierarchy_access" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT can_access_team_hierarchy(team_id))
  );
```

---

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### 1. Composite Indexes for Common Queries

```sql
-- If queries often filter by org AND sort by created_at
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_org_created
  ON tasks(organization_id, created_at DESC);
```

---

### 2. Partial Indexes for Specific States

```sql
-- If queries often filter by status = 'active'
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_active
  ON tasks(organization_id, created_at DESC)
  WHERE status = 'active';
```

---

### 3. SET search_path in Security Definer Functions

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_orgs()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public  -- ← Explicit schema
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;
```

**Why**: Prevents schema injection attacks and ensures consistent behavior.

---

## Policy Operation Patterns

### SELECT (Read)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "select_policy" ON table_name
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );
```

---

### INSERT (Create)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "insert_policy" ON table_name
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
    AND (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

**Note**: Use `WITH CHECK`, not `USING`, for INSERT.

---

### UPDATE (Modify)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "update_policy" ON table_name
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Can only update records in own organization
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Cannot transfer to different organization
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
    AND (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

**Note**: Both `USING` (what you can select to update) and `WITH CHECK` (what the updated row must satisfy).

---

### DELETE (Remove)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "delete_policy" ON table_name
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

---

## Verification Patterns

### Check Policy Performance

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE organization_id = 'test-org-id'
LIMIT 100;

-- Expected: Index Scan using idx_tasks_org_id
-- NOT: Seq Scan on tasks
```

---

### Verify No Circular Policies

```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  pg_get_expr(qual, oid) AS policy_condition
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'tasks';

-- Review each policy_condition for joins to source table
```

---

### Test Multi-User Isolation

```sql
-- As user 1
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-1-uuid';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;  -- Should see only user-1's data

-- As user 2
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-2-uuid';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;  -- Should see only user-2's data

RESET ROLE;
```

---

## Summary Checklist

When implementing RLS, always:

- [ ] ✅ Wrap auth.uid() in `(SELECT ...)`
- [ ] ✅ Specify `TO` role in every policy
- [ ] ✅ Use security definer functions for complex logic
- [ ] ✅ Avoid joins to source table (use IN/ANY with subqueries)
- [ ] ✅ Index ALL columns used in policies
- [ ] ✅ Verify performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] ✅ Test with multiple user contexts
- [ ] ✅ Document Context7 findings in implementation
