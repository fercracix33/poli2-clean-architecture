# Phase 5: Performance Verification & Handoff

**STATUS**: Final validation phase - Executed BEFORE creating iteration document

## Purpose

Validate complete implementation (schema, RLS, services) and prepare handoff to UI/UX Expert Agent.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] ✅ All previous phases complete (0-4)
- [ ] ✅ Service tests passing (100%)
- [ ] ✅ Types generated and imported
- [ ] ✅ Database accessible for performance testing

---

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Test Execution Validation

```bash
# Run ALL service tests
cd app
npm run test src/features/[feature]/services/

# Expected output:
# ✓ [feature].service.test.ts
#   ✓ create - should create entity (23ms)
#   ✓ getById - should get entity by ID (18ms)
#   ✓ getById - should return null if not found (15ms)
#   ✓ list - should list entities with pagination (22ms)
#   ✓ list - should filter by organization (19ms)
#   ✓ update - should update entity (21ms)
#   ✓ update - should return null if not found (16ms)
#   ✓ delete - should delete entity (17ms)
#   ✓ delete - should throw if not found (14ms)
#
# Tests: 9 passed, 9 total
# Coverage: 94.2%
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] ✅ ALL tests pass (100%)
- [ ] ✅ No tests skipped or pending
- [ ] ✅ Coverage >90%
- [ ] ✅ No test modifications made

---

### Step 2: RLS Policy Validation

**Verify no circular dependencies**:
```sql
-- Check all policies for the table
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  pg_get_expr(qual, oid) AS policy_condition
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = '[table_name]';
```

**Review each policy_condition**:
- [ ] ✅ No joins to source table
- [ ] ✅ All use TO role specification
- [ ] ✅ All use (SELECT auth.uid()) wrapper
- [ ] ✅ Complex logic uses security definer functions

**Test with multiple users**:
```sql
-- Test as user 1
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-uuid-1';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];  -- Should see user-1's data

-- Test as user 2
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-uuid-2';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table_name];  -- Should see user-2's data

-- Reset
RESET ROLE;
```

---

### Step 3: Performance Validation

**Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE** on common queries:
```sql
-- Simple select (should use index)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM [table_name]
WHERE organization_id = 'test-org-id'
LIMIT 100;

-- Expected output should include:
-- Index Scan using idx_[table]_org_id on [table_name]
-- NOT: Seq Scan on [table_name]
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] ✅ Index scans (NOT sequential scans)
- [ ] ✅ Query time < 50ms for simple operations
- [ ] ✅ RLS evaluation time reasonable

**If sequential scans found**:
- Missing index on filtered column
- Add index in Phase 1
- Re-run EXPLAIN ANALYZE

---

### Step 4: Schema Validation

**Check constraints**:
```sql
SELECT
  conname AS constraint_name,
  contype AS constraint_type
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = '[table_name]'::regclass;
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] ✅ Primary key constraint exists
- [ ] ✅ Foreign key constraints for relationships
- [ ] ✅ Check constraints for validations
- [ ] ✅ Unique constraints include organization_id

## Handoff Preparation

### Document Work in Iteration

**Create**: `PRDs/{domain}/{feature}/supabase-agent/01-iteration.md`

**Use template**: See [ITERATION-TEMPLATE.md](ITERATION-TEMPLATE.md)

**Required sections**:
```markdown
# Supabase Agent - Iteration 01

**Agent**: Supabase Expert
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Status**: Ready for Review

---

## Context
Implementing data layer for [Feature Name]

## Work Completed

### Database Schema
- Created `[table_name]` table with constraints
- Added indexes: organization_id, user_id, created_at, [others]
- Configured RLS policies with security definer functions
- Added triggers for auto-updates

**Schema file**: `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_create_[table].sql`

### Row Level Security
- SELECT policy: Organization-level access using security definer function
- INSERT policy: User verification with organization check
- UPDATE policy: Owner-only access
- DELETE policy: Owner-only access
- Performance: No circular policies, proper indexes

**RLS file**: `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_[table]_rls.sql`

### Data Services
- [Entity]Service with pure CRUD operations
- Proper snake_case ↔ camelCase transformations
- Error handling for all operations
- Type-safe with generated Database types

**Service file**: `app/src/features/[feature]/services/[feature].service.ts`

### TypeScript Types
- Generated from schema: `app/src/lib/database.types.ts`
- All services using generated types
- Compilation passes without errors

## Technical Decisions

1. **RLS Strategy**: Organization-based isolation with security definer functions
   - Rationale: Avoids circular policies, optimizes query performance
   - Context7 finding applied: [specific pattern used]

2. **Index Design**: Composite index (organization_id, created_at DESC)
   - Rationale: Optimizes common list queries with org filter and pagination
   - EXPLAIN ANALYZE verified index usage

3. **Cascade Deletes**: ON DELETE CASCADE for all foreign keys
   - Rationale: Maintain referential integrity, automatic cleanup
   - Discussed with Architect: [decision]

## Evidence

### Service Tests
\```bash
npm run test src/features/[feature]/services/
# PASS: 9/9 tests
# Coverage: 94.2%
\```

### RLS Validation
\```sql
-- Verified with multiple users
-- User 1: 5 records visible
-- User 2: 3 records visible
-- Anonymous: 0 records (blocked by RLS)
\```

### Performance Validation
\```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM [table_name]
WHERE organization_id = 'org-id' LIMIT 100;

-- Result: Index Scan using idx_[table]_org_id
-- Planning Time: 0.123 ms
-- Execution Time: 2.456 ms
\```

## Handoff to UI/UX Expert

**After Architect + User approval**, Architect will:

1. Create `ui-ux-expert/00-request.md`
2. (Optional) Create `supabase-agent/handoff-001.md` for parallelism
3. Notify UI/UX Expert to begin Phase

**What UI/UX Expert receives**:
- Complete data services ready to use
- Use cases from Implementer (via Architect coordination)
- Entities with Zod schemas
- Database with working RLS

**UI/UX Expert responsibilities**:
- Create React components using shadcn/ui
- Integrate with use cases via TanStack Query
- Make E2E tests pass (from Test Agent)
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

---

## Common Final Issues

❌ **Tests pass but performance is slow**
- **Problem**: Missing indexes on filtered columns
- **Fix**: Add indexes, verify with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

❌ **RLS policies work but queries time out**
- **Problem**: Circular policies or missing indexes
- **Fix**: Review policy conditions, ensure no joins to source table

❌ **Type errors after generation**
- **Problem**: Services using wrong type structure
- **Fix**: Update type aliases in services

❌ **Coverage below 90%**
- **Problem**: Untested error paths
- **Fix**: Ensure tests cover null returns, errors

---

## Time Estimate

**Expected duration**: 15-20 minutes
- Test validation: 5 minutes
- RLS validation: 5 minutes
- Performance validation: 5 minutes
- Documentation: 5-10 minutes

---

## Success Criteria

Your work is complete when:

✅ All service tests pass (100%)
✅ RLS policies validated (no circular dependencies)
✅ Performance verified (EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows index usage)
✅ Types generated and compilation passes
✅ Iteration document complete with evidence
✅ Submitted for Architect + User review
