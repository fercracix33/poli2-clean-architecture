# Supabase Expert Skill References

References are loaded **on demand** when specific technical guidance is needed during implementation.

## Available References

### Core Workflow Phases (load sequentially)

1. **PHASE-0-RESEARCH.md** - Mandatory Context7 consultation phase
   - When to consult: BEFORE any implementation (mandatory first step)
   - Contains: Context7 query patterns, research checklist, documentation verification workflow

2. **PHASE-1-SCHEMA.md** - Database schema design
   - When to consult: After Context7 research, before RLS policies
   - Contains: Schema templates, multi-tenancy patterns, indexing strategies, constraint design

3. **PHASE-2-RLS.md** - Row Level Security policies (MOST CRITICAL)
   - When to consult: After schema design, before service implementation
   - Contains: RLS best practices, security definer functions, performance optimization, verification workflows

4. **PHASE-3-SERVICES.md** - Pure data service implementation
   - When to consult: After RLS policies are validated
   - Contains: CRUD patterns, snake_case â†” camelCase transformations, error handling, TypeScript types

5. **PHASE-4-TYPES.md** - TypeScript type generation
   - When to consult: After services are implemented
   - Contains: Supabase CLI workflows, type import patterns, validation

6. **PHASE-5-VALIDATION.md** - Testing, performance verification, and handoff
   - When to consult: Before creating iteration document
   - Contains: Test validation, EXPLAIN ANALYZE workflows, handoff template

### Critical References (load when implementing RLS - Phase 2)

7. **RLS-ANTI-PATTERNS.md** - What NOT to do (prevents 80% of errors)
   - When to consult: BEFORE writing any RLS policy
   - Contains: Common mistakes with examples, validation checklist, safe patterns
   - Context7 equivalent: RLS performance and best practices troubleshooting

8. **RLS-BEST-PRACTICES.md** - Proven patterns from Context7
   - When to consult: While implementing RLS policies
   - Contains: Security definer functions, caching strategies, multi-tenant isolation patterns
   - Context7 source: Latest Supabase RLS documentation

### Supporting References (load as needed)

9. **TEMPLATES.md** - Complete code templates for all phases
   - When to consult: When starting any phase implementation
   - Contains: Schema DDL, RLS SQL, service TypeScript, migration patterns

10. **ITERATION-TEMPLATE.md** - Iteration documentation template
    - When to consult: When documenting work in XX-iteration.md
    - Contains: Required sections, evidence formats, coverage checklist

11. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
    - When to consult: When encountering errors or unexpected behavior
    - Contains: RLS debugging, performance issues, type mismatches, test failures

## Update Policy

References should be refreshed when:
- Context7 Supabase documentation changes (check quarterly)
- New RLS patterns emerge (monitor Supabase GitHub)
- PostgreSQL version updates (currently targeting 15+)
- Common mistakes are identified in production
- Technology versions change (Supabase JS client, Next.js)

## Context7 Equivalent Queries

For latest patterns, use these Context7 queries:

```typescript
// RLS best practices (CRITICAL - use before Phase 2)
mcp__context7__get_library_docs({
  libraryID: "/supabase/supabase",
  topic: "RLS row level security policies performance joins security definer circular",
  tokens: 3000
})

// Schema design patterns
mcp__context7__get_library_docs({
  libraryID: "/supabase/supabase",
  topic: "schema design indexes foreign keys constraints multi-tenancy",
  tokens: 2500
})

// TypeScript client patterns
mcp__context7__get_library_docs({
  libraryID: "/supabase/supabase",
  topic: "TypeScript client queries CRUD operations error handling",
  tokens: 2000
})
```

## Loading Strategy

**Progressive Disclosure**:
1. SKILL.md references phases by name
2. Agent loads specific phase when needed
3. Phase references additional documents (RLS-ANTI-PATTERNS, etc.)
4. Agent loads those on demand

**Never load all references upfront** - this wastes context window tokens.
