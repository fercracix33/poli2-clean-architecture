# RLS Anti-Patterns - What NOT to Do

**PURPOSE**: Catalog the most common RLS mistakes that cause 80% of production issues. Read this BEFORE implementing any RLS policy.

**SOURCE**: Context7 consultation + production experience

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 1: Circular Policies (Joining to Source Table)

### The Problem

**CRITICAL FAILURE**: Joining back to the source table in an RLS policy creates circular dependencies and prevents query optimization.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ CIRCULAR: Joins tasks.team_id back to source table
CREATE POLICY "circular_bad" ON tasks
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id
      FROM team_members
      WHERE team_members.team_id = tasks.team_id  -- ⚠️ CIRCULAR!
    )
  );
```

**Why This Fails**:
- References `tasks.team_id` within the policy for `tasks` table
- Creates infinite loop in query planner
- Performance degrades exponentially with table size
- Can cause query timeouts or crashes

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ SAFE: No join to source table
CREATE POLICY "safe_good" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id
      FROM team_members
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())  -- No reference to tasks
    )
  );
```

**Why This Works**:
- Subquery is independent of source table
- Query planner can optimize as a pre-filter
- Performance scales linearly with data

### Best Practice: Security Definer Function

```sql
-- BEST: Use security definer function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_team_ids()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT team_id FROM team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;

CREATE POLICY "optimal" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT get_user_team_ids())
  );
```

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 2: Missing TO Clause

### The Problem

Not specifying `TO` role causes the policy to evaluate for ALL database roles (anon, authenticated, service_role).

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Evaluates for all roles
CREATE POLICY "no_role" ON tasks
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- When anonymous user queries, policy still evaluates (wasteful)
-- When service_role queries, policy still evaluates (unnecessary)
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Only evaluates for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "with_role" ON tasks
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

**Impact**: 30-50% performance improvement for public endpoints.

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 3: auth.uid() Without SELECT Wrapper

### The Problem

Calling `auth.uid()` directly prevents Postgres from caching the result, causing it to re-evaluate per row.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ SLOW: auth.uid() called for every row
CREATE POLICY "slow" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- On a table with 10,000 rows, auth.uid() is called 10,000 times
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ FAST: auth.uid() called once and cached (initPlan)
CREATE POLICY "fast" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

-- On a table with 10,000 rows, auth.uid() is called ONCE
```

**Performance Impact**: Up to 100x faster on large tables.

**Query Plan Difference**:
```sql
-- Bad (without SELECT):
-- Seq Scan on tasks (cost=10000.00)
--   Filter: (auth.uid() = user_id)  -- Called per row

-- Good (with SELECT):
-- Index Scan using idx_tasks_user_id (cost=8.44)
--   Index Cond: (user_id = $0)  -- initPlan executed once
```

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 4: Missing Indexes on RLS Columns

### The Problem

Creating RLS policies on unindexed columns causes sequential scans instead of index scans.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Create policy without index
CREATE POLICY "unindexed" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows:
-- Seq Scan on tasks (cost=0.00..10000.00 rows=500000)
-- Filter: ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id)
-- Rows Removed by Filter: 499900
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Create index FIRST, then policy
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);

CREATE POLICY "indexed" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows:
-- Index Scan using idx_tasks_user_id (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=100)
-- Index Cond: (user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()))
```

**Performance Impact**: 100-1000x faster on large tables.

**Rule**: Create indexes on ALL RLS-filtered columns BEFORE enabling RLS.

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 5: Complex Logic Directly in Policy

### The Problem

Embedding complex joins, CTEs, or business logic directly in RLS policies makes them unmaintainable and slow.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Complex logic in policy
CREATE POLICY "complex_bad" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM users u
      JOIN team_members tm ON u.id = tm.user_id
      JOIN teams t ON tm.team_id = t.id
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
        AND t.id = tasks.team_id
        AND t.active = true
        AND tm.role IN ('admin', 'member')
    )
  );
```

**Problems**:
- Hard to debug
- Cannot be tested independently
- Poor query plan optimization
- Duplicated across multiple policies
- Maintenance nightmare

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Extract to security definer function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can_access_task_team(task_team_id UUID)
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM users u
    JOIN team_members tm ON u.id = tm.user_id
    JOIN teams t ON tm.team_id = t.id
    WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
      AND t.id = task_team_id
      AND t.active = true
      AND tm.role IN ('admin', 'member')
  );
END;
$$;

CREATE POLICY "complex_good" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT can_access_task_team(team_id))
  );
```

**Benefits**:
- Testable independently
- Reusable across policies
- Clearer intent
- Better query optimization
- Easier maintenance

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 6: Wrong Clause for INSERT/UPDATE

### The Problem

Using `USING` instead of `WITH CHECK` for INSERT, or omitting `WITH CHECK` entirely.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: INSERT policy without WITH CHECK
CREATE POLICY "insert_bad" ON tasks
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  USING (organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_orgs()));

-- User can INSERT with ANY organization_id (SECURITY HOLE!)
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: INSERT policy with WITH CHECK
CREATE POLICY "insert_good" ON tasks
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_orgs())
    AND (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );

-- ✅ GOOD: UPDATE policy with both USING and WITH CHECK
CREATE POLICY "update_good" ON tasks
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Can only update tasks in your orgs
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_orgs())
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Cannot transfer task to different org
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_orgs())
    AND (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

**Rule**:
- INSERT: Use `WITH CHECK` only
- UPDATE: Use both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`
- SELECT: Use `USING` only
- DELETE: Use `USING` only

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 7: Business Validation in RLS

### The Problem

Using RLS policies to enforce business rules instead of data access control.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Business logic in RLS
CREATE POLICY "business_bad" ON tasks
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
    AND status != 'completed'  -- ⚠️ Business rule!
    AND due_date > now()       -- ⚠️ Business rule!
  );
```

**Why This is Wrong**:
- RLS is for ACCESS CONTROL, not business validation
- Fails silently (no error message to user)
- Business rules belong in use cases
- Impossible to provide meaningful error messages

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: RLS for access control only
CREATE POLICY "access_good" ON tasks
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );

-- Business validation in use case layer (Implementer Agent)
// Use case validates business rules
if (task.status === 'completed') {
  return { success: false, error: 'Cannot modify completed tasks' }
}
if (task.dueDate < new Date()) {
  return { success: false, error: 'Cannot modify overdue tasks' }
}
```

**Rule**: RLS = WHO can access. Use cases = WHAT operations are allowed.

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 8: Not Testing RLS Policies

### The Problem

Deploying RLS policies without testing them with actual user contexts.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Create policy and deploy without testing
CREATE POLICY "untested" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (team_id IN (SELECT get_user_teams()));

-- Deploy to production... oops, users see wrong data!
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Test with multiple user contexts
CREATE POLICY "tested" ON tasks
  TO authenticated
  USING (team_id IN (SELECT get_user_teams()));

-- Test as user 1
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-1-uuid';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;  -- Should see user-1's tasks

-- Test as user 2
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-2-uuid';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;  -- Should see user-2's tasks

-- Test as anonymous (should see nothing or get error)
RESET ROLE;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;
```

**Rule**: ALWAYS test RLS with at least 2 different user contexts before deployment.

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 9: Missing SET search_path

### The Problem

Not setting `search_path` in security definer functions can lead to schema injection attacks.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: No search_path specified
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_orgs()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER  -- Runs with elevated privileges
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Explicit search_path
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_orgs()
  RETURNS SETOF UUID
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public  -- ← Prevents schema injection
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
END;
$$;
```

**Why**: Malicious users could create tables in their own schema to hijack the function's behavior.

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 10: Forgetting Composite Indexes

### The Problem

Indexing only single columns when policies filter on multiple columns.

### Wrong Implementation

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Only single-column indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_org_id ON tasks(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_created_at ON tasks(created_at);

-- Query filters by both columns
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE organization_id = 'org-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Uses only one index, then sorts
```

### Correct Implementation

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Composite index for common query pattern
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_org_created
  ON tasks(organization_id, created_at DESC);

-- Query uses composite index efficiently
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE organization_id = 'org-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Rule**: Create composite indexes for common filter + sort combinations.

## Quick Reference: Safe Patterns

```sql
-- ✅ Organization isolation
CREATE POLICY "org" ON [table]
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (SELECT get_user_organization_ids())
  );

-- ✅ Owner-only access
CREATE POLICY "owner" ON [table]
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id)
  WITH CHECK ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

-- ✅ Team access (with helper function)
CREATE POLICY "team" ON [table]
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT get_user_team_ids())
  );

-- ✅ Role-based access
CREATE POLICY "admin" ON [table]
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (SELECT has_role('admin')) OR (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id
  );
```

**When in doubt, use a security definer function instead of complex inline logic.**

**Read this document BEFORE implementing RLS. It will save you hours of debugging.**
