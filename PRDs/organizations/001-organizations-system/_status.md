# Feature Status: organizations-001-multi-tenant-system

**Feature ID**: organizations-001
**Status**: 🔴 IMPLEMENTED BUT BLOCKED
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14 (Initial PRD Creation)

---

## Overall Progress

```
█████░░░░░ 50% Complete
```

**Architecture**: ✅ COMPLETE (9.5/10)
**Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETE (12 use cases)
**Tests**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (60/87 passing - 69%)
**Production Ready**: ❌ BLOCKED (RLS recursion)

---

## Blocking Issues

### 🔴 CRITICAL: RLS Recursion (P0 - BLOCKING PRODUCTION)

**Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "organization_members"` (code 42501)

**Impact**: Users cannot create organizations. Feature is non-functional.

**Assigned To**: ⏳ Supabase Agent (Phase 2 - ready to start)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED

---

## Agent Status

### Phase 1: Fix Test Mocking (PARALLEL)

**Agent**: Test Agent
**Priority**: MEDIUM (not blocking, but needed for CI/CD)
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix `organization.test.ts` (8 tests failing)
- [ ] Fix `organization-membership.test.ts` (9 tests failing)
- [ ] Fix `roles-permissions.test.ts` (3 tests failing)
- [ ] Fix `security-rls.test.ts` (6 tests failing)
- [ ] Verify all 87 tests pass
- [ ] Confirm coverage >90%

**Current Progress**: 0/27 tests fixed

**Blockers**: None (can run in parallel with Phase 2)

---

### Phase 2: Fix RLS Recursion (CRITICAL PATH)

**Agent**: Supabase Agent
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocking production deployment)
**Status**: ⏳ READY TO START
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Use Supabase MCP to inspect RLS policies
- [ ] Use Context7 MCP to research solutions
- [ ] Identify root cause policy
- [ ] Create SECURITY DEFINER function migration
- [ ] Add `addFirstOrganizationMemberInDB()` to service layer
- [ ] Update `createOrganization` use case to use new function
- [ ] Test organization creation (manual + automated)
- [ ] Verify multi-tenant isolation still enforced
- [ ] Document solution in PRD

**Current Progress**: 0/9 steps complete

**Blockers**: None (ready to start immediately)

---

### Phase 3: E2E Testing (AFTER PHASE 2)

**Agent**: UI/UX Expert Agent
**Priority**: HIGH (needed for production)
**Status**: ⏸️ BLOCKED (waiting for Phase 2 completion)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Run E2E test: Create organization flow
- [ ] Run E2E test: Join organization flow
- [ ] Run E2E test: Member management
- [ ] Run E2E test: Leave organization
- [ ] Run E2E test: Delete organization
- [ ] Fix any UI issues discovered
- [ ] Lighthouse audit >90

**Current Progress**: 0/7 steps complete

**Blockers**: Waiting for Phase 2 (organization creation must work first)

## Metrics

### Test Coverage

**Overall**: 60/87 tests passing (69%)

**By Category**:
- ✅ Organization Details: 10/10 (100%)
- ✅ Organization Updates: 11/11 (100%)
- ✅ Organization Deletion: 12/12 (100%)
- ✅ Leave Organization: 11/11 (100%)
- ✅ Invite Code Regeneration: 8/8 (100%)
- ✅ Organization Stats: 8/8 (100%)
- ❌ Organization Creation: 1/9 (11%)
- ❌ Organization Membership: 0/9 (0%)
- ❌ Roles & Permissions: 0/3 (0%)
- ❌ Security RLS: 0/6 (0%)

**Target**: 87/87 (100%) with >90% coverage

---

### Feature Functionality

**Implemented**:
- ✅ 12 use cases complete
- ✅ 23 service functions complete
- ✅ API routes created
- ✅ UI components created
- ✅ i18n complete (en/es)

**Blocked**:
- ❌ Organization creation (RLS error)
- ❌ First member addition (RLS error)

**Working**:
- ✅ Get user organizations (if manually added to DB)
- ✅ Join organization (if organization exists)
- ✅ Member management (if organization exists)
- ✅ Organization settings (if organization exists)

---

### Architecture Quality

**Clean Architecture Score**: 9.5/10

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Perfect layer separation
- ✅ Pure entities (Zod only)
- ✅ Pure services (no business logic)
- ✅ Business logic in use cases
- ✅ Components use TanStack Query

**Minor Issues**:
- ⚠️ Some service functions could be more granular
- ⚠️ Test mocking syntax needs correction

---

## Timeline

**Created**: 2025-10-14 (Retroactive PRD)
**Phase 1 Start**: TBD (Test Agent ready)
**Phase 2 Start**: TBD (Supabase Agent ready)
**Phase 3 Start**: TBD (blocked by Phase 2)
**Target Completion**: 2025-10-14 + 3-4 hours

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- 🔴 **RLS Recursion**: If SECURITY DEFINER solution doesn't work, may need complex policy refactoring (adds 2-4 hours)
- 🟡 **Security Regression**: SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS - must validate no security holes introduced

### Medium Risk
- 🟡 **Test Mocking**: If pattern is more complex than expected, may take longer (low probability)
- 🟡 **E2E Test Failures**: UI may have issues discovered during E2E testing (adds 1-2 hours)

### Low Risk
- 🟢 **Performance**: Organization creation should be fast (<2s) with SECURITY DEFINER
- 🟢 **Compatibility**: Solution is backward compatible, no breaking changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Start Phase 1 (Test Agent)**:
   ```
   Read: PRDs/organizations/001-organizations-system/00-master-prd.md
   Focus: Section 5 (Issue 2: Test Mocking)
   Files: 4 test files to fix
   Output: 87/87 tests passing
   ```

2. **Start Phase 2 (Supabase Agent)** - CRITICAL:
   ```
   Read: PRDs/organizations/001-organizations-system/00-master-prd.md
   Focus: Section 5 (Issue 1: RLS Recursion)
   MCPs: Supabase MCP, Context7 MCP
   Output: Working organization creation
   ```

### After Phase 2 Completion

3. **Start Phase 3 (UI/UX Agent)**:
   ```
   Read: PRDs/organizations/001-organizations-system/00-master-prd.md
   Focus: Section 9 (Testing Strategy - E2E)
   Output: Passing E2E test suite
   ```

## Notes

- This is a **RETROACTIVE PRD** documenting an already-implemented feature
- Architecture is EXCELLENT (9.5/10) - no refactoring needed
- Focus is on REMEDIATION (fixing blockers), not new development
- Test Agent and Supabase Agent can work in PARALLEL
- UI/UX Agent is BLOCKED until Supabase Agent completes Phase 2
