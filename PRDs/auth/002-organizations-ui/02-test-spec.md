# Test Specifications: Organizations UI (Retroactive - CORRECTED)

## Referencia
- **Master PRD:** `00-master-prd.md`
- **Supabase Spec:** `01-supabase-spec.md` (Pendiente - ya existe DB)
- **Feature ID:** auth-002
- **Assigned Agent:** Test Agent
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (with Phase 0 corrections applied)
- **Created:** 2025-10-10
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-10 (Phase 0 architectural refactoring)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PHASE 0 ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTION APPLIED

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: After Phase 0 refactoring, organizations functionality was moved from `features/auth/` to `features/organizations/` following Screaming Architecture principles.

### Correct Paths (Post-Phase 0)
- **Test Files**: `app/src/features/organizations/use-cases/*.test.ts`
- **Service Mock**: `vi.mock('../services/organization.service')` (NOT auth.service)
- **Implementation Files**: `app/src/features/organizations/use-cases/*.ts`

---

## üö® RETROACTIVE TEST CREATION NOTICE

This test specification is being created RETROACTIVELY as part of the TDD Remediation Plan (Phase 1.3). These tests should have been created BEFORE implementation but are now being added to establish a comprehensive specification for the missing use cases.

### Context
- **Missing Use Cases:** 6 critical use cases were never implemented
- **UI Implementation:** Exists but makes direct database queries (violates Clean Architecture)
- **Tests Corrected:** 56 tests across 6 use case files (mock paths fixed)
- **Purpose:** Define specification that Implementer Agent will follow

---

## 1. Estrategia de Testing

### Cobertura Objetivo
- **Use Cases:** >90% cobertura de l√≠neas para cada use case
- **Branch Coverage:** >85% para todas las rutas l√≥gicas
- **Total Tests:** 60 tests (56 required + 4 bonus for comprehensive coverage)
- **API Endpoints:** NOT covered here (endpoints don't exist yet)

### Herramientas
- **Framework:** Vitest (NOT Jest - prohibited by project rules)
- **Mocking:** vi.mock() for service layer
- **Assertions:** expect() with Vitest matchers
- **Coverage:** c8 (bundled with Vitest)

### Testing Philosophy
- **TDD Red-Green-Refactor:** All tests MUST FAIL initially (RED phase)
- **Immutable Tests:** Once created, tests are the specification (DO NOT modify)
- **Mock All External:** No real database calls, all Supabase mocked
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation:** Focus on inputs/outputs, not internal logic

## 3. Mocking Strategy

### Service Layer Functions to Mock

```typescript
// From organization.service.ts (NOT auth.service - Phase 0 refactored)
vi.mock('../services/organization.service', () => ({
  // Organization queries
  getOrganizationBySlugFromDB: vi.fn(),
  getOrganizationByIdFromDB: vi.fn(),
  updateOrganizationInDB: vi.fn(),
  deleteOrganizationFromDB: vi.fn(),

  // Membership queries
  isUserMemberOfOrganization: vi.fn(),
  getUserRoleInOrganization: vi.fn(),
  removeUserFromOrganizationInDB: vi.fn(),
  countOrganizationMembersFromDB: vi.fn(),
  countOrganizationAdminsFromDB: vi.fn(),

  // Permission queries
  userHasPermissionInOrganization: vi.fn(),
  getUserPermissionsInOrganization: vi.fn(),
}));
```

### Mock Data Fixtures

```typescript
// Test constants
const USER_ID = 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-4aaa-8aaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa';
const OWNER_ID = 'bbbbbbbb-bbbb-4bbb-8bbb-bbbbbbbbbbbb';
const ORGANIZATION_ID = 'cccccccc-cccc-4ccc-8ccc-cccccccccccc';

const MOCK_ORGANIZATION = {
  id: ORGANIZATION_ID,
  name: 'Test Organization',
  slug: 'test-organization',
  description: 'Test description',
  invite_code: 'TESTCODE',
  created_by: OWNER_ID,
  created_at: new Date('2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'),
  updated_at: new Date('2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'),
};

const MOCK_MEMBER_ROLE = {
  id: 'role-member-id',
  name: 'organization_member',
};

const MOCK_ADMIN_ROLE = {
  id: 'role-admin-id',
  name: 'organization_admin',
};

const MOCK_OWNER_ROLE = {
  id: 'role-owner-id',
  name: 'organization_owner',
};
```

---

## 4. Test File Structure (Template)

### Standard Test File Pattern

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { [useCaseName] } from './[useCaseName]';
import * as organizationService from '../services/organization.service';

// Mock service layer
vi.mock('../services/organization.service');

// Test constants
const USER_ID = 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-4aaa-8aaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa';
const ORGANIZATION_ID = 'cccccccc-cccc-4ccc-8ccc-cccccccccccc';

describe('[UseCaseName]', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('Success Cases', () => {
    it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', async () => {
      // Arrange
      vi.mocked(organizationService.someFunction).mockResolvedValue(mockData);

      // Act
      const result = await [useCaseName](params);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);
      expect(organizationService.someFunction).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedParams);
    });
  });

  describe('Error Cases', () => {
    it('should throw [error] when [condition]', async () => {
      // Arrange
      vi.mocked(organizationService.someFunction).mockRejectedValue(new Error('...'));

      // Act & Assert
      await expect([useCaseName](params)).rejects.toThrow('...');
    });
  });

  describe('Validation', () => {
    it('should reject invalid input when [condition]', async () => {
      // Act & Assert
      await expect([useCaseName](invalidParams)).rejects.toThrow('...');
    });
  });

  describe('Authorization', () => {
    it('should enforce permission checks', async () => {
      // Mock permission denied
      vi.mocked(organizationService.userHasPermissionInOrganization).mockResolvedValue(false);

      // Act & Assert
      await expect([useCaseName](params)).rejects.toThrow('Insufficient permissions');
    });
  });
});
```

---

## 5. Expected Initial Test Results

### RED Phase Verification

When tests are first run, ALL 60 tests MUST FAIL with errors like:

```
‚ùå FAIL  app/src/features/organizations/use-cases/getOrganizationDetails.test.ts
  ‚óè getOrganizationDetails ‚Ä∫ Success Cases ‚Ä∫ should return organization with details when user is member

    TypeError: getOrganizationDetails is not a function

      at Object.<anonymous> (getOrganizationDetails.test.ts:15:20)

‚ùå FAIL  app/src/features/organizations/use-cases/updateOrganizationDetails.test.ts
  ‚óè updateOrganizationDetails ‚Ä∫ Success Cases ‚Ä∫ should update name and description

    TypeError: updateOrganizationDetails is not a function

      at Object.<anonymous> (updateOrganizationDetails.test.ts:18:20)

[... 58 more similar failures ...]

Test Suites: 6 failed, 6 total
Tests:       60 failed, 60 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.5s
```

**This is CORRECT and EXPECTED.**

// Do NOT add istanbul ignore comments unless absolutely necessary
```

---

## 7. Test Execution Commands

### Run All Auth Tests
```bash
cd app
npm run test -- src/features/organizations/use-cases
```

### Run Specific Use Case Tests

## 9. Known Limitations & Future Work

### Out of Scope for This Phase
- **API Endpoint Tests:** Endpoints don't exist yet, will be created later
- **Component Tests:** E2E tests already cover UI, unit tests optional
- **Performance Tests:** Optimization phase comes after functionality works
- **Security Audit:** Will be done after all layers are implemented

### Future Enhancements
- Add integration tests when API endpoints are created
- Add performance benchmarks for stats calculations
- Add security penetration tests
- Add accessibility tests for permission-based UI states

---

## 10. Handoff to Implementer Agent

### What Implementer Must Do

1. **Read Tests First:** Understand requirements from test expectations
2. **Implement Use Cases:** Create 6 use case files that make tests pass
3. **Follow TDD:** Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
4. **NO Test Modifications:** Tests are immutable specification
5. **Achieve Coverage:** >90% for all use cases
6. **Update Status:** Run `/agent-handoff auth/002-organizations-ui implementer completed`

### What Implementer Must NOT Do

- ‚ùå Modify ANY test files (tests are specification)
- ‚ùå Implement data services (Supabase Agent's job - already done)
- ‚ùå Implement API endpoints (comes after use cases)
- ‚ùå Implement UI refactoring (UI/UX Agent's job)
- ‚ùå Skip tests or reduce coverage to make implementation "easier"

### Critical Reminders

- **Use Existing Services:** `organization.service.ts` already has all needed functions (refactored from auth.service in Phase 0)
- **Follow Existing Patterns:** Look at `createOrganization.ts` as reference
- **Zod Validation:** Use entities from `entities.ts` for input validation
- **Permission Checks:** Always validate user permissions before operations
- **Error Messages:** Be specific and user-friendly
- **Console Logging:** Follow existing pattern for audit trail

---

## 11. Success Criteria

### Tests Pass
- ‚úÖ All 60 tests pass without modification
- ‚úÖ No test.skip or test.todo remaining
- ‚úÖ All assertions execute successfully

### Coverage Met
- ‚úÖ >90% statement coverage per use case
- ‚úÖ >85% branch coverage per use case
- ‚úÖ >95% function coverage per use case

### Quality Standards
- ‚úÖ Use cases are pure business logic (no direct DB access)
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod
- ‚úÖ Permission checks enforced
- ‚úÖ Error handling comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Code follows existing patterns

### Architecture Compliance
