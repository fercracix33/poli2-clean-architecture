## Critical Decisions Made

### 1. Use "workspaces" NOT "organizations"

**Decision:** Use "workspace" terminology throughout
**Rationale:** Analysis document uses "workspaces", cleaner terminology
**Impact:** All legacy "organization" references must be cleaned up

### 2. Phase 1 is Backend Only (NO UI)

**Decision:** Phase 1 excludes all UI implementation
**Rationale:** Focus on foundation (database + RLS + minimal use cases)
**Impact:**
- NO React components
- NO E2E tests (Playwright)
- NO API endpoints (Phase 2)
- NO CASL implementation (Phase 3) - only types defined

### 3. Minimal Use Cases in Phase 1

**Decision:** ONLY 2 use cases: createWorkspace, assignRole
**Rationale:** Phase 1 is FOUNDATION, not features
**Impact:** Complex business logic deferred to Phase 5+

### 4. CASL Types Defined, Not Implemented

**Decision:** entities.ts has CASL types, but NO `defineAbilityFor` implementation
**Rationale:** CASL implementation is Phase 3 scope
**Impact:** Implementer Agent does NOT create `abilities/` folder

### 5. user_profiles Modification

**Decision:** DEFER to Supabase Agent analysis during implementation
**Recommendation:** NO modification (workspace context from `workspace_users` only)
**Rationale:** Keep profiles simple, workspace context in dedicated table
**Impact:** Supabase Agent documents decision in iteration

### 6. Supabase Client (NOT Prisma)

**Decision:** Use Supabase Client for all database access
**Rationale:** Prisma incompatible with RLS (JWT not passed)
**Impact:** Type safety via Supabase Type Generation + Zod

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: RLS Performance Degradation

**Severity:** High
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive indexing strategy (7+ indexes)
- Performance tests verify < 50ms RLS evaluation
- Query profiling in Supabase Agent iteration

### Risk 2: Cross-Workspace Data Leak

**Severity:** Critical
**Probability:** Low (with RLS)
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive RLS tests by Test Agent
- Security advisor run by Supabase Agent
- Manual review of all RLS policies by Architect

### Risk 3: Incomplete Tests

**Severity:** Medium
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Test Agent has detailed requirements
- Coverage targets enforced (100% entities, >90% use cases)
- Architect reviews test completeness before approval

### Risk 4: Service Logic Creep

**Severity:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Services must be pure CRUD (documented in request)
- Architect reviews service implementation
- Test Agent verifies no business logic in services

  ‚Üì
Architect Review (Day 1-2) ‚Üí Approve/reject

**Earliest Completion:** 3 weeks from Test Agent start
**Latest Completion:** 4 weeks (if iterations needed)
